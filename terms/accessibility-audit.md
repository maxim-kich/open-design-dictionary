# Accessibility Audit

## Definition
A systematic evaluation of a product's compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG) and usability for people with disabilities. Accessibility audits use automated tools, manual testing, and assistive technology to identify barriers and ensure inclusive design.

## Examples
- Testing a website with screen readers to identify issues for blind users
- Evaluating color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels against WCAG 2.1 Level AA

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use both automated tools and manual testing
- Test with actual assistive technologies
- Involve users with disabilities when possible
- Document issues with severity levels
- Test across different assistive technologies
- Create remediation plan with priorities

**Don'ts**
- Rely only on automated accessibility checkers
- Skip manual keyboard navigation testing
- Ignore WCAG guidelines and levels
- Test only with one assistive technology
- Treat accessibility as one-time audit
- Forget to retest after fixes
