# Affinity Diagramming

## Definition
A collaborative method for organizing large amounts of qualitative data by grouping related observations, ideas, or insights into clusters. Affinity diagramming synthesizes research findings into patterns and reveals relationships between data points.

## Examples
- Organizing sticky notes with user quotes and observations from interviews into thematic groups
- Clustering usability test findings to identify common issues and prioritize fixes

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Write one observation per sticky note
- Work collaboratively with the team
- Group silently before discussing
- Let patterns emerge naturally from the data
- Create hierarchy with sub-groups if needed
- Label groups with clear, descriptive names

**Don'ts**
- Start with predetermined categories
- Work alone when team synthesis is valuable
- Write multiple ideas on one note
- Rush the grouping process
- Force data into artificial categories
- Skip naming the final groups
