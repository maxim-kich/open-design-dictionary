# Beta Testing

## Definition
Releasing a product or feature to a limited group of real users in production environment before full launch. Beta testing identifies issues, gathers feedback, and validates performance with actual usage patterns and data.

## Examples
- Releasing a new feature to 5% of users to catch bugs and gather initial feedback
- Inviting power users to test beta version and provide early feedback

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Select beta users who match target audience
- Set clear expectations about beta status
- Provide feedback channels for beta users
- Monitor metrics and gather qualitative feedback
- Plan for rollback if major issues arise
- Thank and reward beta participants

**Don'ts**
- Beta test with all users at once
- Release beta without monitoring plan
- Ignore feedback from beta users
- Skip internal testing before beta
- Leave features in beta indefinitely
- Forget to communicate with beta testers
