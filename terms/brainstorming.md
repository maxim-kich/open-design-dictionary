# Brainstorming

## Definition
A group creativity technique for generating a large number of ideas in a short time by encouraging free thinking and deferring judgment. Brainstorming leverages diverse perspectives to explore solution spaces broadly before evaluating ideas.

## Examples
- Running a 30-minute session where team members generate ideas for improving onboarding flow
- Using brainstorming to explore different approaches to solving a navigation problem

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Defer judgment and criticism during ideation
- Encourage wild and ambitious ideas
- Build on others' ideas
- Aim for quantity over quality initially
- Use a facilitator to keep energy and focus
- Document all ideas visually

**Don'ts**
- Critique or evaluate ideas during generation
- Let dominant voices monopolize the session
- Stop too early before exhausting possibilities
- Brainstorm without a clear problem statement
- Skip the synthesis and prioritization step afterward
- Brainstorm individually when group diversity adds value
