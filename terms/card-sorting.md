# Card Sorting

## Definition
A research method where participants organize topics or content into categories that make sense to them. Card sorting reveals how users mentally model information and helps inform information architecture and navigation structure.

## Examples
- Having users group feature names into categories to inform app navigation structure
- Asking participants to organize content topics to design a website's information hierarchy

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use realistic content labels that users will encounter
- Choose between open sorting (users create categories) or closed sorting (predefined categories)
- Test with 15-30 participants for reliable patterns
- Look for agreement in groupings across participants
- Follow up with tree testing to validate structure
- Use digital tools for remote card sorting

**Don'ts**
- Use too many cards (30-60 is typical maximum)
- Use internal jargon or unclear labels
- Rely on card sorting alone for IA decisions
- Skip analysis of disagreements and outliers
- Force participants into categories that don't make sense
