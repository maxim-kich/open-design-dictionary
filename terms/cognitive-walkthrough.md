# Cognitive Walkthrough

## Definition
An expert evaluation method that assesses how easy an interface is to learn by walking through tasks from a new user's perspective. Cognitive walkthrough focuses on learnability and whether users can understand what to do without training.

## Examples
- Evaluating a new feature by asking "Will users know what to do?" at each step
- Walking through first-time user flow to identify where new users might get confused

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Define realistic tasks and user personas
- Ask four key questions at each step
- Focus on first-time use and learnability
- Document assumptions and findings
- Involve multiple evaluators
- Use early in design process

**Don'ts**
- Evaluate expert user flows
- Skip defining user characteristics
- Rush through the walkthrough
- Focus on efficiency over learnability
- Work alone without discussion
- Use cognitive walkthrough for all usability issues
