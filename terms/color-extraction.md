# Color Extraction

## Definition
A method for deriving color palettes from existing visual sources such as photographs, brand materials, or artwork. Extraction identifies dominant, secondary, and accent colors from an image to create cohesive palettes grounded in real-world references.

## Examples
- Extracting brand colors from a company logo to build a UI palette
- Pulling dominant colors from a hero image to create a themed landing page
- Deriving a color scheme from a mood board for a new product direction
- Using a photograph as the basis for an illustration color palette

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use multiple source images to find common color themes
- Adjust extracted colors for accessibility (contrast, saturation)
- Extract both dominant and subtle accent colors
- Consider the emotional tone of source images
- Validate extracted palettes against UI requirements

**Don'ts**
- Use extracted colors directly without accessibility testing
- Rely on a single image for an entire palette
- Ignore that extracted colors may lack sufficient contrast
- Forget to create tonal variations from extracted base colors
- Assume extracted palettes work for all UI states (hover, disabled, etc.)
