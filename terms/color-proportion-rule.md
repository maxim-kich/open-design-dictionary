# Color Proportion Rule

## Definition
A color distribution guideline that suggests using a dominant color for 60% of the design, a secondary color for 30%, and an accent color for 10%. This ratio creates visual balance and hierarchy while preventing color overload.

## Examples
- Using a neutral background (60%), brand color for headers and cards (30%), and a contrasting CTA color (10%)
- Applying white/light gray as dominant, dark gray for text and containers, and blue for interactive elements
- In a dashboard: light background (60%), data containers (30%), status indicators and buttons (10%)

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use the dominant 60% for backgrounds and large surfaces
- Apply the 30% to secondary elements like navigation, cards, or sections
- Reserve the 10% for calls to action and key interactive elements
- Treat the rule as a guideline, not an exact formula
- Adjust ratios slightly based on content density and purpose

**Don'ts**
- Use the accent color for large areas
- Make the secondary color compete with the accent
- Apply the rule rigidly without considering content needs
- Forget that the rule applies to visual weight, not pixel count
- Use multiple accent colors at 10% each (dilutes impact)
