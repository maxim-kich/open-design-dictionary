# Color Schemes

## Definition
A structured method for selecting harmonious color combinations based on their relationships on the color wheel. Common schemes include complementary (opposite colors), analogous (adjacent colors), triadic (three equidistant colors), and split-complementary (one color plus two adjacent to its complement).

## Examples
- Using a complementary scheme (blue and orange) to create strong visual contrast for CTAs
- Applying an analogous scheme (blue, blue-green, green) for a calm, cohesive interface
- Choosing a triadic scheme (red, yellow, blue) for a vibrant, balanced design
- Using split-complementary to get contrast without the intensity of pure complementary

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Start with a primary color and derive others using scheme rules
- Use complementary schemes for elements that need to stand out
- Use analogous schemes for harmonious, low-contrast designs
- Adjust saturation and lightness within the scheme for variety
- Test schemes with real content and UI components

**Don'ts**
- Use all colors from a scheme at equal intensity
- Apply triadic schemes without careful balance (can be overwhelming)
- Ignore the 60-30-10 rule when applying color schemes
- Rely solely on the color wheel without testing in context
- Forget that color schemes are starting points, not rigid rules
