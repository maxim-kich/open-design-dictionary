# Comparison Testing

## Definition
A research method where participants evaluate multiple design alternatives side-by-side to determine preferences and relative strengths. Comparison testing helps teams make decisions between competing approaches by understanding user reasoning.

## Examples
- Showing users three different homepage layouts and asking which best helps them find information
- Comparing two onboarding flows to see which users find clearer and more engaging

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Test 2-4 alternatives maximum
- Rotate presentation order to avoid bias
- Ask participants to explain their preferences
- Look for patterns across participants
- Test alternatives at similar fidelity levels
- Use findings to inform hybrid solutions

**Don'ts**
- Show too many alternatives at once
- Present alternatives in the same order to everyone
- Accept preference without understanding reasoning
- Assume the most popular option is always best
- Compare alternatives at different fidelity levels
- Let comparison testing replace usability testing
