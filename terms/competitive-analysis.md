# Competitive Analysis

## Definition
Systematic evaluation of competing products, services, or companies to understand their strengths, weaknesses, features, and strategies. Competitive analysis identifies market opportunities, industry standards, and differentiation opportunities.

## Examples
- Reviewing 5-10 similar apps to understand common features and design patterns before building
- Analyzing competitor pricing models and value propositions to inform product strategy

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Focus on direct and indirect competitors
- Look at features, design patterns, and user experience
- Document both strengths and weaknesses
- Consider business model and positioning
- Update analysis regularly as market evolves
- Use findings to inform, not dictate, design decisions

**Don'ts**
- Copy competitors without understanding user needs
- Only analyze obvious direct competitors
- Ignore competitors' weaknesses and failures
- Treat competitive analysis as one-time activity
- Let competitor features drive your roadmap
- Forget to analyze why competitors made certain choices
