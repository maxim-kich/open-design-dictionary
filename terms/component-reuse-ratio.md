# Component Reuse Ratio

## Definition
Ratio of total components created to unique component types, where higher ratios indicate better reuse and system efficiency.

## Examples
- 150 total cards / 3 card variants = 50:1
- 89 buttons / 4 button types = 22:1
- 42 modals / 2 modal variants = 21:1
- Overall reuse ratio: 28:1

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Track per component type
- Improve lowest ratios first
- Celebrate reuse champions

**Don'ts**
- Count total instances only
- Ignore variant quality
- Compare unrelated components
- Skip context consideration
