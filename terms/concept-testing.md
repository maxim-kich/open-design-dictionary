# Concept Testing

## Definition
Evaluating an idea, feature, or product concept with users before significant development investment. Concept testing validates assumptions, gauges user interest, and identifies potential issues early when changes are still inexpensive.

## Examples
- Showing mockups of a new feature to users and asking about usefulness and clarity
- Presenting different product concepts to target customers to assess appeal and fit

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Test early before significant investment
- Use realistic but low-fidelity representations
- Ask about comprehension, appeal, and differentiation
- Test multiple concepts to compare
- Recruit representative users
- Focus on understanding "why" behind reactions

**Don'ts**
- Wait until development is complete to test
- Over-polish concepts, which can bias feedback
- Lead participants toward positive responses
- Test only one concept without alternatives
- Confuse concept testing with usability testing
- Make decisions based on small sample sizes
