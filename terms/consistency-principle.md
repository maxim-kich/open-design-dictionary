# Consistency Principle

## Definition
Same actions produce same results everywhere.

- ESC always closes modals
- Same icons same meaning

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Document patterns centrally
- Component library usage
- Cross-platform consistency
- Regular design audits

**Don'ts**
- Different gestures by screen
- Moving primary button
- Icon reuse different meaning
- Platform-specific patterns
