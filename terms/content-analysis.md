# Content Analysis

## Definition
A systematic method for analyzing textual, visual, or audio content by categorizing and coding data into themes. Content analysis transforms qualitative information into quantifiable insights through structured examination.

## Examples
- Coding customer support tickets to identify the most common complaint categories
- Analyzing social media posts to understand sentiment and recurring topics

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Define clear coding categories before starting
- Ensure categories are mutually exclusive
- Code consistently across all content
- Calculate inter-rater reliability with multiple coders
- Document your coding scheme
- Use software tools for large datasets

**Don'ts**
- Use overlapping or ambiguous categories
- Let a single coder handle all analysis
- Change coding scheme midway without re-coding
- Ignore context when coding content
- Skip validation of coding reliability
- Overcomplicate the coding scheme
