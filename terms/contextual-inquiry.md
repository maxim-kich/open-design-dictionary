# Contextual Inquiry

## Definition
A qualitative research method combining observation and interview in the user's actual work environment. Researchers observe users performing tasks in their natural context while asking questions to understand their motivations, challenges, and workflows.

## Examples
- Observing nurses in a hospital while they use medical record software during their shift
- Watching office workers manage email and calendar tasks in their actual workspace

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Conduct sessions in the user's actual environment, not a lab
- Let the user lead and perform their normal tasks
- Ask questions in the moment to understand context
- Take detailed notes about environment and workflow
- Focus on understanding the "why" behind actions

**Don'ts**
- Interrupt users during critical tasks
- Take users out of their natural environment
- Rely solely on what users say without observing behavior
- Make assumptions about their workflow
- Rush through the session
