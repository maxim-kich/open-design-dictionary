# Continuous Discovery

## Definition
An ongoing research practice where product teams regularly interact with customers to inform decisions and validate assumptions throughout development. Continuous discovery embeds research into weekly routines rather than treating it as separate project phases.

## Examples
- Conducting weekly user interviews with existing customers to understand evolving needs
- Regularly observing customer support sessions to identify recurring problems

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Make research a weekly habit, not a phase
- Involve the entire product team in research
- Focus on learning over comprehensive studies
- Keep research lightweight and actionable
- Create systems for sharing insights
- Connect research directly to decisions

**Don'ts**
- Wait for big research projects
- Let only researchers talk to customers
- Collect insights without acting on them
- Make continuous discovery too formal or heavy
- Stop research once product ships
- Ignore what you're learning from support and analytics
