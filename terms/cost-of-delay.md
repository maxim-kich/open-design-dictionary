# Cost of Delay

## Definition
A prioritization approach that quantifies the economic impact of time by calculating the value lost when a decision or initiative is delayed. Cost of Delay helps teams make urgent vs important trade-offs based on financial impact.

## Examples
- Calculating that delaying a checkout fix costs $10,000 per week in lost revenue, making it higher priority
- Comparing cost of delay across features to decide release order

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Estimate economic value in real terms (revenue, cost savings)
- Consider both direct and indirect costs
- Use relative rather than precise calculations
- Combine with effort estimates for CD3 (Cost of Delay Divided by Duration)
- Update estimates as market conditions change
- Use to challenge assumptions about urgency

**Don'ts**
- Get stuck on perfect precision in estimates
- Ignore intangible or long-term value
- Use Cost of Delay as the only prioritization factor
- Forget opportunity costs of not doing other work
- Assume all delays have linear cost curves
- Skip the validation of cost assumptions
