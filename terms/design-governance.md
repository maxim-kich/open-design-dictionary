# Design Governance

## Definition
The framework of processes, policies, and decision-making structures that guide design work and ensure consistency across an organization. Design governance defines who makes decisions, how standards are maintained, and how design quality is upheld.

## Examples
- Establishing an approval process for new design system components
- Creating guidelines for when designers can deviate from established patterns

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Define clear decision-making authority
- Document processes and standards
- Balance consistency with flexibility
- Create escalation paths for conflicts
- Review and update governance regularly
- Make governance proportional to organization size

**Don'ts**
- Create governance that blocks all progress
- Make processes too complex or bureaucratic
- Have governance without clear ownership
- Ignore governance when convenient
- Copy governance from other companies without adapting
- Implement governance without team buy-in
