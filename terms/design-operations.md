# Design Operations

## Definition
The orchestration of people, processes, and tools to enable design teams to create value more effectively. Also called DesignOps, it focuses on operational efficiency, workflow optimization, and removing blockers for designers.

## Examples
- Establishing design file organization standards and naming conventions across teams
- Managing design tool licenses, training, and onboarding processes

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Focus on enabling designers, not controlling them
- Measure and improve workflow efficiency
- Standardize where it creates value
- Build scalable processes as team grows
- Collaborate across product, engineering, and research ops
- Listen to designer pain points

**Don'ts**
- Add process without clear value
- Solve problems designers don't have
- Optimize for ops convenience over designer needs
- Implement rigid, inflexible systems
- Work in isolation from design team
- Forget that DesignOps serves design outcomes
