# Design System Audit

## Definition
A systematic review of a design system and its implementation across products to identify inconsistencies, unused components, and improvement opportunities. Design system audits assess health and alignment between system and products.

## Examples
- Reviewing all products to identify UI patterns not yet documented in the design system
- Analyzing component usage data to identify unused or underutilized components

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Conduct audits regularly (quarterly or biannually)
- Review both the system and product implementations
- Identify inconsistencies and technical debt
- Document findings with evidence
- Prioritize improvements based on impact
- Involve designers and engineers in audit

**Don'ts**
- Audit only the design system files
- Skip checking actual product implementations
- Conduct audits without follow-up actions
- Make audits too infrequent
- Ignore feedback from design system users
- Create massive backlogs without prioritization
