# Design System Maintenance

## Definition
The ongoing process of updating, improving, and supporting a design system to keep it relevant, usable, and aligned with product needs. Maintenance includes component updates, documentation improvements, version management, user support, and governance activities.

## Examples
- Conducting quarterly design system audits to identify outdated components and inconsistencies
- Creating a contribution process for teams to propose new components or patterns
- Updating design tokens when brand guidelines change across all components
- Providing support channels for designers and developers using the system
- Versioning the system and communicating breaking changes to stakeholders
- Tracking component usage to identify unused or underutilized patterns

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Treat the design system as a product with dedicated resources
- Establish clear governance processes and decision-making protocols
- Create channels for user feedback and support requests
- Schedule regular audits of the system and products using it
- Document changes and maintain a public roadmap
- Communicate updates proactively to all users

**Don'ts**
- Assume the design system is "done" after initial launch
- Let the system diverge from actual product implementations
- Make breaking changes without migration guidance
- Ignore feedback from designers and engineers using the system
- Maintain components that no one uses
- Manage the design system as a side project without dedicated time
