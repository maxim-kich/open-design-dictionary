# Diary Studies

## Definition
A longitudinal research method where participants self-report their experiences, behaviors, and activities over an extended period. Diary studies capture context and patterns that emerge over time in users' natural environments.

## Examples
- Having users log their fitness app usage daily for two weeks to understand engagement patterns
- Asking parents to document their morning routines with children over a month to identify pain points

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Provide clear instructions and templates for entries
- Keep entry requirements simple and quick
- Set realistic timeframes and frequency
- Send reminders to maintain participation
- Compensate participants appropriately
- Combine with follow-up interviews for depth

**Don'ts**
- Make diary entries too time-consuming or complex
- Run studies for too long without breaks
- Ignore dropout rates and incomplete entries
- Rely solely on self-reported data
- Forget to pilot test your diary format
