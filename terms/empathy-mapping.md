# Empathy Mapping

## Definition
A collaborative visualization tool that captures what users say, think, feel, and do to build shared understanding of user needs and behaviors. Empathy maps synthesize research observations into a simple, digestible format organized into four quadrants.

## Examples
- Creating an empathy map after user interviews to align the team on user motivations and pain points
- Using empathy maps in workshops to build empathy for different user segments

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Base maps on real research data, not assumptions
- Use the four quadrants: Says, Thinks, Does, Feels
- Create maps collaboratively with cross-functional teams
- Focus on one persona or user segment per map
- Update maps as you learn more about users
- Use maps to generate insights and "How Might We" questions

**Don'ts**
- Create empathy maps without user research
- Confuse empathy maps with personas
- Include too much detail or make them complex
- Use the same map for multiple different user types
- Treat empathy maps as final deliverables
- Skip the synthesis step after creating maps
