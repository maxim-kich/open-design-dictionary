# Fake Door Test

## Definition
A validation technique that measures interest in a feature by adding an entry point for it in the interface before building it. Also called Smoke Test, fake door tests use click-through rates to assess demand and prevent wasted effort on unwanted features.

## Examples
- Adding a "Premium Analytics" menu item that leads to a coming soon page to measure interest
- Including a button for an unbuilt feature to see how many users attempt to access it

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Make the entry point realistic and discoverable
- Communicate clearly when users click through
- Track both clicks and user characteristics
- Follow up with interested users for feedback
- Use to validate demand before building
- Be transparent about feature status

**Don'ts**
- Frustrate users with too many fake doors
- Mislead users about feature availability
- Test features you don't intend to build
- Ignore users who show interest
- Use fake doors in production indefinitely
- Create fake doors for critical features users expect
