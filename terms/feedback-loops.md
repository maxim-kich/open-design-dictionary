# Feedback Loops

## Definition
Systematic mechanisms for collecting, analyzing, and acting on information to drive continuous improvement. Feedback loops create cycles where outputs inform future inputs, enabling teams to learn and adapt iteratively.

## Examples
- Weekly review of customer support tickets to identify recurring issues
- Monthly synthesis of usability test findings to inform design priorities

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Create short feedback loops for faster learning
- Close the loop by acting on feedback
- Make feedback loops systematic and regular
- Share learnings across the organization
- Measure the impact of changes
- Combine multiple feedback sources

**Don'ts**
- Collect feedback without acting on it
- Make feedback loops too long
- Rely on a single feedback source
- Skip communicating what you learned
- Let feedback loops become performative
- Ignore negative or uncomfortable feedback
