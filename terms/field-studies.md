# Field Studies

## Definition
Research conducted in the user's natural environment by observing behavior and interactions in real-world contexts. Also called ethnographic research, field studies reveal how users actually behave rather than how they say they behave.

## Examples
- Observing shoppers in a retail store to understand browsing and purchasing behavior
- Spending time with delivery drivers to understand their daily workflow and challenges

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Immerse yourself in the user's environment
- Observe actual behavior over extended periods
- Document environmental factors that influence behavior
- Build rapport and trust with participants
- Look for patterns across multiple observations
- Capture photos and videos when appropriate

**Don'ts**
- Make quick judgments based on limited observation
- Ignore the context surrounding user behavior
- Rely only on what users say without observing
- Conduct field studies in artificial settings
- Forget to get proper permissions and consent
