# Fitts's Law

## Definition
Time to reach target inversely proportional to size, directly proportional to distance.

## Examples
- Large buttons easier to tap
- Menu items at screen edges
- Primary CTA full viewport width
- Thumb-friendly mobile targets

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Make important targets large
- Place targets near cursor path
- Minimize pointer travel distance
- Use keyboard shortcuts

**Don'ts**
- Tiny touch targets (<44px)
- Deeply nested menus
- Targets in screen corners
- Inconsistent sizing
