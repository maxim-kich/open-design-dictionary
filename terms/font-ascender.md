# Font Ascender

## Definition
Part of lowercase letters that extends above the x-height line (e.g., 'h', 'k', 'l', 'b', 'd'). Ascenders contribute to letter differentiation and rhythm in text blocks.

## Examples
- Ensuring adequate line spacing to prevent ascender collision
- Checking ascender clarity in fonts used for small text
- Evaluating ascender proportions when selecting typefaces
- Testing how ascenders affect vertical rhythm in layouts

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Ensure ascenders have adequate space from lines above
- Use fonts where ascenders are clearly defined
- Account for ascender height in line spacing calculations
- Test ascender clarity at small sizes

**Don'ts**
- Crop or hide ascenders in UI layouts
- Use excessive line height that breaks ascender-descender balance
- Choose fonts with weak or ambiguous ascenders
- Ignore ascender impact on visual rhythm
