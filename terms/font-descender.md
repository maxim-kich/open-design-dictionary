# Font Descender

## Definition
Part of lowercase letters that extends below the baseline (e.g., 'g', 'j', 'p', 'q', 'y'). Descenders require adequate vertical space and affect line height calculations in UI design.

## Examples
- Reserving space below text in buttons to prevent descender clipping
- Adjusting form field heights to accommodate descenders
- Testing descender rendering in different fonts
- Ensuring descenders don't overlap with content below

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Reserve sufficient space below baseline for descenders
- Account for descenders in button and form field sizing
- Ensure descenders don't overlap with elements below
- Use consistent descender depth across typefaces

**Don'ts**
- Crop descenders in UI elements
- Ignore descender space in line height calculations
- Use fonts with inconsistent descender lengths
- Place descenders too close to content below
