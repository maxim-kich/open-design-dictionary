# Font Hierarchy

## Definition
Use of size, weight, color, and style to denote content importance and guide user focus. Font hierarchy creates visual structure that helps users scan and understand content priority.

## Examples
- Using H1 for page titles, H2 for sections, body for content
- Combining larger size with bold weight for primary headings
- Using color to differentiate links from body text
- Creating caption styles for secondary information

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use 3-4 hierarchy levels maximum (H1, H2, body, caption)
- Combine size and weight for clear distinction
- Maintain consistent hierarchy across pages
- Use hierarchy to highlight key information

**Don'ts**
- Create too many hierarchy levels (confusing)
- Use weight alone without size variation
- Break hierarchy for decorative purposes
- Apply hierarchy inconsistently across interface
