# Font Kerning

## Definition
Adjustment of space between individual letter pairs to improve visual balance and readability. Kerning compensates for the irregular shapes of letters, making text appear more cohesive.

## Examples
- Adjusting space between 'A' and 'V' to prevent excessive gaps
- Tightening kerning in headlines for visual impact
- Fine-tuning letter pairs in logo design for brand consistency
- Compensating for problematic pairs like 'T' and 'o'

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Kern letter pairs with irregular spacing (e.g., 'A' and 'V')
- Use kerning to improve headlines and large display text
- Adjust kerning proportionally based on font size and context
- Test kerning across different screen sizes and zoom levels

**Don'ts**
- Apply uniform kerning to all letter combinations
- Over-kern, creating excessive gaps between letters
- Ignore font designer's built-in kerning pairs
- Kern small body text at 12px or below (harder to perceive)
