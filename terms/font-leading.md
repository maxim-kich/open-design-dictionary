# Font Leading

## Definition
Vertical space between lines of text (line height). Named after the lead strips used in traditional typography, leading directly impacts readability and visual rhythm in text blocks.

## Examples
- Setting 1.5x line height for body text to improve readability
- Using tighter leading in headlines for compact visual impact
- Increasing leading for long paragraphs to aid scanning
- Adjusting leading proportionally when scaling font sizes

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use 1.4-1.6x line height for body text (optimal for web)
- Increase leading for long paragraphs to aid scanning
- Apply tighter leading to headlines and display text
- Scale leading proportionally with font size

**Don'ts**
- Use leading less than 1.2x for body text (cramped)
- Apply excessive leading that breaks paragraph cohesion
- Ignore leading in mobile contexts (responsive adjustment needed)
- Use fixed pixel-based leading instead of relative units
