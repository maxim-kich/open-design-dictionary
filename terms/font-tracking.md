# Font Tracking

## Definition
Uniform adjustment of space between all letters in a word or line. Unlike kerning, tracking applies the same spacing value across an entire text block for consistent letter density.

## Examples
- Increasing tracking in all-caps headings for improved legibility
- Applying loose tracking to create an elegant, airy feel in display text
- Using negative tracking for dense content to save space
- Adjusting tracking for different font weights

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use tracking for headlines to create emphasis
- Increase tracking for all-caps text to improve legibility
- Apply negative tracking to dense content to save space
- Adjust tracking based on font size and weight

**Don'ts**
- Apply excessive tracking that breaks word cohesion
- Use positive tracking for small body text (reduces readability)
- Forget that tracking affects perceived font weight
- Apply tracking inconsistently across similar elements
