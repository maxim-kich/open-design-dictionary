# Font Weight

## Definition
Thickness of characters in a font (e.g., Light, Regular, Bold, Black). Font weight creates visual emphasis, hierarchy, and contrast while maintaining a consistent typeface family.

## Examples
- Using Regular (400) for body text and Bold (700) for headings
- Applying Light weight for large display text
- Using Semi-Bold (600) for subheadings
- Combining weight variations within a single font family

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use weight variation for hierarchy (Light → Regular → Bold → Black)
- Limit to 2-3 weights per interface for clarity
- Combine weight with size for emphasis
- Test weight rendering across browsers and devices

**Don'ts**
- Use excessive weights that confuse hierarchy
- Mix weights from different font families
- Rely on weight alone for emphasis
- Use extreme weights for body text
