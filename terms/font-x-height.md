# Font X-Height

## Definition
Height of lowercase letters (excluding ascenders and descenders) in a font. X-height significantly influences perceived font size and legibility at small sizes, even when point size remains constant.

## Examples
- Choosing fonts with generous x-height for mobile interfaces
- Comparing x-heights when pairing typefaces for visual harmony
- Selecting high x-height fonts for small UI labels and captions
- Testing perceived size differences between fonts at the same point size

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Choose fonts with generous x-height for small body text (10-14px)
- Consider x-height when pairing typefaces
- Test x-height perception across different sizes
- Account for x-height in accessibility considerations

**Don'ts**
- Ignore x-height when selecting fonts for readability
- Mix fonts with vastly different x-heights in hierarchy
- Assume point size alone determines legibility
- Use fonts with tiny x-height for UI text
