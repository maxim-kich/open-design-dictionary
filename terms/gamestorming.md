# Gamestorming

## Definition
A set of facilitation techniques that use game mechanics and playful activities to enhance ideation, problem-solving, and collaboration. Gamestorming structures creative sessions with clear rules, goals, and time constraints to increase engagement and output.

## Examples
- Using "6-3-5" where 6 people sketch 3 ideas in 5 minutes, then pass papers to iterate
- Playing "Crazy Eights" to rapidly generate 8 different solution sketches in 8 minutes

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Choose games that match your objective
- Explain rules clearly before starting
- Set time limits to maintain energy
- Use visual and physical materials
- Debrief and reflect after games
- Combine multiple games in a session

**Don'ts**
- Use games without clear purpose
- Let games run too long without timeboxing
- Skip the warm-up activities
- Force participation without explaining benefits
- Use complex games with unclear rules
- Forget to capture insights and outputs
