# Gestalt Proximity

## Definition
Close elements perceived as grouped; spacing defines relationships and creates visual chunks.

## Examples
- Form fields grouped by topic with spacing between sections
- Navigation items clustered together, separate from content
- Related buttons grouped close together vs isolated actions
- Card components with consistent padding creating groups

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Group related form fields together
- Use consistent spacing scales
- Test grouping perception with users
- Apply proximity consistently

**Don'ts**
- Scatter related elements randomly
- Use inconsistent spacing
- Overcrowd proximity groups
- Ignore responsive spacing
