# Glyph

## Definition
Individual character or symbol in a font, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and special symbols. Each glyph is a unique visual unit designed to work within a typeface system.

## Examples
- Checking if a font includes currency glyphs needed for international use
- Verifying special character availability for multilingual content
- Testing glyph rendering for mathematical symbols
- Ensuring icon fonts have all required glyphs

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Ensure all required glyphs are included in your font selection
- Test glyph rendering for special characters
- Account for missing glyphs in fallback strategies
- Verify glyph consistency across font weights

**Don'ts**
- Assume all glyphs render identically across fonts
- Use custom glyphs without fallbacks
- Ignore glyph availability for multilingual content
- Mix glyphs from different fonts without testing
