# Heuristic Evaluation

## Definition
An expert review method where evaluators examine an interface against established usability principles (heuristics) to identify usability problems. Heuristic evaluation is quick, inexpensive, and effective for finding issues without involving users.

## Examples
- Reviewing a website against Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics to identify violations
- Having 3-5 UX experts independently evaluate an app and consolidate their findings

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use established heuristic sets (Nielsen's 10, etc.)
- Have 3-5 evaluators work independently
- Document severity ratings for each issue
- Consolidate findings from multiple evaluators
- Follow up with usability testing
- Focus on issues that violate clear principles

**Don'ts**
- Rely only on heuristic evaluation
- Have evaluators work together initially
- Skip severity ratings
- Use only one evaluator
- Ignore domain-specific heuristics
- Let personal preferences override heuristics
