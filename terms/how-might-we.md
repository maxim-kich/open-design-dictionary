# How Might We

## Definition
A question format that reframes problems as opportunities for ideation by using "How might we..." to open possibilities. HMW questions turn insights and challenges into actionable springboards for generating solutions.

## Examples
- Reframing "Users abandon cart" into "How might we give users confidence during checkout?"
- Converting "Feature is hard to find" into "How might we make key features more discoverable?"

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Start with user insights or problem statements
- Make questions broad enough to allow solutions
- Keep questions specific enough to be actionable
- Generate multiple HMW questions per problem
- Use HMW questions to launch brainstorming
- Frame questions positively as opportunities

**Don'ts**
- Create questions that are too broad or vague
- Suggest solutions within the question
- Frame questions negatively
- Stop at one HMW question per problem
- Use HMW without prior research or insights
- Let HMW questions replace problem definition
