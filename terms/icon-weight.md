# Icon Weight

## Definition
Thickness of strokes or boldness of filled shapes in icons. Icon weight creates visual hierarchy and differentiates icon importance within interface.

## Examples
- Light weight (1px) for subtle background icons
- Regular weight (2px) for primary actions
- Bold weight (3px) for emphasis and focal points
- Ultra-bold for icon badges or warnings

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use weight progression for hierarchy
- Maintain consistent weight ratio across set
- Scale weight proportionally with icon size
- Test weight visibility at small sizes

**Don'ts**
- Mix weights randomly
- Use extreme weights for standard icons
- Ignore weight-size relationship
- Change weight inconsistently
