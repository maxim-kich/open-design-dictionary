# Journey Mapping

## Definition
A visualization of the process a user goes through to accomplish a goal, showing their actions, thoughts, emotions, and pain points across touchpoints over time. Journey maps synthesize research data to create a shared understanding of user experience and identify improvement opportunities.

## Examples
- Mapping a patient's journey through a healthcare system from symptom discovery to post-treatment follow-up
- Documenting a customer's experience buying a product, from initial awareness through purchase and support
- Visualizing an employee's onboarding journey to identify friction points in the first 90 days
- Creating a map of a traveler's airport experience to uncover service design opportunities

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Base maps on actual research data, not assumptions
- Include emotional journey alongside actions and touchpoints
- Identify pain points and opportunities clearly
- Create maps collaboratively with cross-functional teams
- Focus on a specific persona and specific goal
- Use maps to drive actionable improvements, not just documentation

**Don'ts**
- Create journey maps without user research
- Make maps too complex or detailed to be useful
- Map every possible path (focus on primary scenarios)
- Forget to include backstage processes that affect user experience
- Create a journey map and then never reference it again
- Confuse journey maps with service blueprints or user flows
