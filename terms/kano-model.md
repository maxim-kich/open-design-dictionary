# Kano Model

## Definition
A prioritization framework that categorizes features based on their relationship to customer satisfaction. The Kano Model classifies features as Basic Needs, Performance Needs, or Delighters to help teams understand which features create the most value.

## Examples
- Identifying that fast loading is a Basic Need (expected) while personalized recommendations are Delighters (exceed expectations)
- Using Kano surveys to determine which proposed features will most increase satisfaction

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Survey customers to classify features
- Understand that feature categories change over time
- Focus on Delighters for differentiation
- Ensure all Basic Needs are met first
- Use Kano with other prioritization methods
- Re-evaluate feature categories periodically

**Don'ts**
- Ignore Basic Needs in favor of Delighters
- Assume feature categories are permanent
- Over-invest in Performance features alone
- Skip customer research in classification
- Use Kano for internal features or technical work
- Forget that competitors' Delighters become your Basic Needs
