# Landing Page Test

## Definition
A lean validation method that uses a simple web page to gauge market interest in a product or feature before building it. Landing page tests measure conversion rates to assess demand and collect leads from interested users.

## Examples
- Creating a landing page describing a planned feature with a "Sign up for early access" button to measure interest
- Building a page for a product concept and running ads to test market demand

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Clearly describe the value proposition
- Include a clear call-to-action to measure intent
- Drive qualified traffic to the page
- Measure both interest and behavioral signals
- Be transparent about product status
- Follow up with interested users

**Don'ts**
- Mislead users about product availability
- Test without driving meaningful traffic
- Only measure clicks without understanding why
- Create overly complex landing pages
- Ignore qualitative feedback from visitors
- Promise features you can't deliver
