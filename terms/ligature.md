# Ligature

## Definition
Special glyph that combines two or more characters into a single unified form for improved visual flow and appearance (e.g., 'fi', 'fl', 'ffi'). Ligatures enhance readability and aesthetics in typography.

## Examples
- Enabling 'fi' and 'fl' ligatures in headline text
- Using discretionary ligatures for decorative branding elements
- Disabling ligatures in code editors for character clarity
- Testing ligature rendering across different browsers

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Enable ligatures in display and heading text
- Use standard ligatures (fi, fl, ff, ffi, ffl)
- Disable ligatures in code or technical contexts
- Test ligature rendering across browsers

**Don'ts**
- Force ligatures in body text at small sizes
- Use discretionary ligatures in UI body copy
- Enable ligatures where they break legibility
- Ignore ligature support in fallback fonts
