# Line Length

## Definition
Number of characters per line of text. Optimal line length is 45-75 characters (or 8-12 words), balancing readability with scanning ease. Line length significantly impacts reading speed and comprehension.

## Examples
- Setting max-width on text containers to achieve 60 characters per line
- Using narrower columns on mobile for comfortable reading
- Adjusting line length responsively between breakpoints
- Testing line length with actual content rather than lorem ipsum

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Target 50-60 characters per line for optimal readability
- Adjust line length responsively for mobile (shorter) and desktop (longer)
- Use adequate line height to support longer line lengths
- Test line length with actual content

**Don'ts**
- Use excessively long lines (>100 characters)
- Use extremely short lines (<30 characters)
- Ignore line length in responsive design
- Use fixed line length across all screen sizes
