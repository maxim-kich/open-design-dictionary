# Mind Mapping

## Definition
A visual thinking technique that organizes information hierarchically around a central concept, with related ideas branching outward. Mind mapping helps explore connections between ideas and structure thinking during ideation and problem-solving.

## Examples
- Creating a mind map of user needs with branches for different need categories and sub-branches for specific requirements
- Mapping out feature ideas organized by user goals

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Start with a clear central concept or question
- Use keywords and short phrases, not sentences
- Add visual elements like colors and icons
- Let ideas branch naturally and non-linearly
- Create connections between different branches
- Use digital or physical tools based on context

**Don'ts**
- Make the map too complex or detailed
- Organize linearly like an outline
- Overthink the structure during creation
- Use only text without visual hierarchy
- Create mind maps alone when collaboration would help
- Forget to synthesize insights after mapping
