# Monadic Testing

## Definition
A research approach where each participant evaluates only one design or concept in isolation, without comparison to alternatives. Monadic testing provides unbiased feedback on each option's absolute merits without comparative context influencing responses.

## Examples
- Testing a new feature design where half of participants see version A only and half see version B only
- Evaluating product concepts by showing each participant just one concept to get clean reactions

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use when you need unbiased absolute evaluations
- Recruit larger sample sizes (need more participants per variant)
- Ask about clarity, appeal, and usefulness
- Compare results statistically across groups
- Ensure groups are demographically similar
- Use for concepts where comparison creates bias

**Don'ts**
- Use monadic testing when direct comparison would be valuable
- Show multiple variants to the same participant
- Underestimate required sample size
- Skip validation that groups are comparable
- Use when you have very limited participants
- Forget that monadic tests are more expensive
