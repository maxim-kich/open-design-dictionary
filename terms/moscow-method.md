# MoSCoW Method

## Definition
A prioritization framework that categorizes requirements or features into four groups: Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have. MoSCoW helps teams agree on priorities and manage scope by making trade-offs explicit.

## Examples
- Labeling user authentication as "Must have" and dark mode as "Could have" for MVP launch
- Using MoSCoW to decide what features to cut when facing timeline constraints

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Define clear criteria for each category
- Limit "Must haves" to truly essential items
- Revisit categorization as priorities change
- Use MoSCoW for scope management and release planning
- Get stakeholder alignment on categories
- Document reasoning for classifications

**Don'ts**
- Make everything a "Must have"
- Use MoSCoW without time constraints context
- Let politics override user needs in classification
- Ignore "Won't haves" indefinitely
- Skip the difficult prioritization conversations
- Apply MoSCoW without understanding dependencies
