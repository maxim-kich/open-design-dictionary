# Multivariate Testing

## Definition
A quantitative testing method that evaluates multiple variables simultaneously to determine which combination of changes produces the best outcome. Multivariate testing tests all possible combinations of variables to find optimal designs.

## Examples
- Testing combinations of headline, image, and button text to find the best-performing version
- Evaluating different layouts, colors, and copy simultaneously on a landing page

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Have sufficient traffic for testing multiple combinations
- Test variables that are likely to interact
- Define clear success metrics upfront
- Ensure statistical significance
- Use when you need to test combinations
- Plan for exponential growth in variants

**Don'ts**
- Use multivariate testing with low traffic
- Test variables that don't interact
- Add too many variables (traffic requirement grows exponentially)
- Ignore the complexity of analysis
- Use when simple A/B testing would suffice
- Forget that each combination needs sufficient data
