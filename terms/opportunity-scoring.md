# Opportunity Scoring

## Definition
A prioritization method that identifies opportunities by measuring the gap between how important a need is and how satisfied users currently are. The largest gaps represent the biggest opportunities for improvement.

## Examples
- Surveying users on importance and satisfaction with features to find the biggest gaps
- Identifying that "fast search" is important but users are unsatisfied, creating a high-priority opportunity

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Ask users to rate both importance and satisfaction
- Calculate opportunity scores (Importance - Satisfaction)
- Focus on high importance, low satisfaction items
- Use standardized scales for consistent measurement
- Survey enough users for reliable data
- Combine with other prioritization inputs

**Don'ts**
- Focus only on satisfaction without importance
- Ignore items that are important and satisfactory (maintain these)
- Use opportunity scoring for exploratory innovation
- Skip validation of why satisfaction is low
- Treat opportunity scores as the only decision factor
- Survey infrequently and treat scores as permanent
