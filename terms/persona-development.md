# Persona Development

## Definition
Creating fictional yet realistic representations of key user segments based on research data. Personas include demographics, behaviors, goals, motivations, and pain points to help teams empathize with and design for specific user types.

## Examples
- Developing 3-4 primary personas representing different user types for an e-commerce platform
- Creating personas for healthcare providers with different specializations and technology comfort levels

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Base personas on actual user research data
- Include goals, behaviors, and pain points
- Keep to 3-5 primary personas maximum
- Make personas specific and believable
- Use personas to guide design decisions
- Update personas as you learn more

**Don'ts**
- Create personas from assumptions or stereotypes
- Include too many personas
- Add irrelevant personal details
- Use personas as the only research artifact
- Make personas too generic or vague
- Create personas and never reference them
