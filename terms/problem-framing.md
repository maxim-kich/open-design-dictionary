# Problem Framing

## Definition
The process of clearly defining and articulating a problem before seeking solutions. Problem framing shapes how teams understand challenges and influences the range of solutions they consider.

## Examples
- Reframing "users don't complete checkout" to "users feel uncertain about shipping costs during checkout"
- Transforming "add more features" into "users can't find the features they need"

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Base problem statements on research insights
- Frame problems from the user's perspective
- Make problem statements specific and actionable
- Challenge assumptions about the problem
- Explore multiple framings of the same problem
- Align stakeholders on the problem before solutioning

**Don'ts**
- Jump to solutions before framing the problem
- Frame problems around internal constraints only
- Use vague or overly broad problem statements
- Let stakeholder opinions replace user research
- Stick with the first problem framing
- Frame problems that assume a specific solution
