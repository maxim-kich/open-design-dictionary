# Product Analytics

## Definition
The practice of collecting and analyzing quantitative data about how users interact with a product. Product analytics tools track behavior, usage patterns, funnels, and metrics to inform design and product decisions.

## Examples
- Tracking feature adoption rates to understand which new features users find valuable
- Analyzing drop-off points in checkout funnel to identify design improvements

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Define metrics that align with business and user goals
- Combine quantitative data with qualitative research
- Track behavior, not just outcomes
- Set up event tracking deliberately
- Review analytics regularly with team
- Use insights to generate hypotheses for research

**Don'ts**
- Rely only on analytics without user research
- Track everything without purpose
- Make decisions based on vanity metrics
- Ignore the "why" behind the numbers
- Forget to validate tracking implementation
- Let analytics replace talking to users
