# Prototype Testing

## Definition
Evaluating an interactive representation of a design with users to validate functionality, flow, and usability before full development. Prototype testing uses clickable mockups or working prototypes to simulate the final experience.

## Examples
- Testing an interactive Figma prototype of a new checkout flow with target users
- Validating a coded prototype of mobile gestures with real users on devices

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Choose prototype fidelity appropriate to questions being tested
- Give users realistic tasks to complete
- Observe behavior more than collecting opinions
- Test critical paths and edge cases
- Iterate based on findings before building
- Document issues and prioritize fixes

**Don'ts**
- Build high-fidelity prototypes for everything
- Explain how the prototype should work
- Test only happy paths
- Defend design choices during testing
- Prototype features you can't build
- Skip prototype testing to save time
