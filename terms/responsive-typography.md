# Responsive Typography

## Definition
Scaling text proportionally using relative units (em, rem, %) across different screen sizes and devices. Responsive typography ensures readability and maintains visual hierarchy from mobile to desktop.

## Examples
- Using rem units for font sizes that scale with root font size
- Implementing CSS clamp() for fluid typography between breakpoints
- Scaling heading sizes down on mobile while maintaining hierarchy ratios
- Adjusting line height and letter spacing responsively

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use relative units (rem, em) instead of fixed pixels
- Scale font sizes based on viewport width
- Test typography across breakpoints
- Maintain hierarchy ratios responsively

**Don'ts**
- Use fixed pixel sizes for responsive design
- Ignore mobile typography needs
- Scale too aggressively between breakpoints
- Forget to test actual device rendering
