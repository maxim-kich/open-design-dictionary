# Retrospectives

## Definition
A structured team reflection practice where members review what went well, what didn't, and what to improve for future work. Retrospectives create space for honest discussion and continuous team improvement.

## Examples
- Monthly design team retrospective reviewing recent projects and identifying process improvements
- Post-project retrospective to capture learnings before starting next initiative

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Hold retrospectives regularly (sprint, monthly, post-project)
- Create psychological safety for honest feedback
- Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- Turn insights into actionable improvements
- Rotate facilitators to get different perspectives
- Track action items and follow through

**Don'ts**
- Skip retrospectives when busy
- Let retrospectives become blame sessions
- Discuss only what went wrong
- Generate action items without ownership
- Have the same format every time
- Ignore patterns that emerge across retrospectives
