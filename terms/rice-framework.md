# RICE Framework

## Definition
A prioritization framework that scores ideas based on four factors: Reach (number of users affected), Impact (effect on individual users), Confidence (certainty of estimates), and Effort (time required). RICE was developed by Intercom's product team to make objective, data-driven prioritization decisions.

## Examples
- Comparing feature requests by calculating RICE scores to determine roadmap priorities
- Evaluating marketing campaigns by estimating reach, impact, confidence, and effort before launch
- Prioritizing bug fixes by assessing how many users are affected and implementation complexity
- Scoring design improvements to identify highest-value, lowest-effort changes

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use consistent metrics for reach across all items being compared
- Scale impact consistently (typically 0.25 to 3: minimal, low, medium, high, massive)
- Be honest about confidence levels (use percentages: 50%, 80%, 100%)
- Estimate effort in person-weeks or story points
- Recalculate scores as new information emerges
- Combine RICE with qualitative judgment for final decisions

**Don'ts**
- Manipulate scores to justify predetermined decisions
- Compare RICE scores across completely different types of work
- Use RICE as the only factor in prioritization
- Skip the effort estimation step
- Ignore low-scoring items that address critical user needs
- Apply RICE to every minor decision (overhead not worth it)
