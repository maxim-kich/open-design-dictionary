# Sans-Serif Fonts

## Definition
Clean typefaces without decorative strokes (serifs) at letter ends (e.g., Helvetica, Inter, Roboto). Sans-serifs are the modern standard for UI design, offering clarity and legibility on screens.

## Examples
- Using Inter or Roboto as primary UI font
- Applying SF Pro for iOS applications
- Choosing Open Sans for web interfaces
- Using geometric sans-serifs for modern, minimal designs

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use sans-serifs as default for UI text
- Choose humanist or geometric sans-serifs for personality
- Test sans-serif rendering at all sizes
- Use sans-serifs for accessibility

**Don'ts**
- Mix too many sans-serif families
- Use poorly-hinted sans-serifs at small sizes
- Apply decorative sans-serifs to body text
- Ignore sans-serif optical sizing needs
