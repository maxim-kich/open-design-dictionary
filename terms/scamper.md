# SCAMPER

## Definition
A structured creativity framework using seven prompts to generate new ideas by modifying existing products or concepts: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse. SCAMPER provides systematic questions to spark creative thinking.

## Examples
- Using SCAMPER to reimagine an existing feature by asking "What if we combined checkout with product recommendations?"
- Applying SCAMPER questions to generate mobile app improvements

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Work through each letter systematically
- Apply multiple SCAMPER prompts to same problem
- Use concrete examples when answering prompts
- Combine SCAMPER with other ideation methods
- Document ideas generated from each prompt
- Adapt questions to your specific context

**Don'ts**
- Rush through the prompts superficially
- Skip prompts that seem less relevant
- Use SCAMPER on blank slate problems (works best with existing concepts)
- Apply only one or two prompts
- Expect all prompts to generate equally valuable ideas
- Use SCAMPER as the only ideation approach
