# Text Alignment

## Definition
Positioning of text relative to margins or guides: left-aligned, center-aligned, right-aligned, or justified. Text alignment affects readability, visual flow, and information hierarchy in UI layouts.

## Examples
- Left-aligning body text for optimal readability
- Center-aligning headlines and hero text
- Right-aligning numbers in data tables for easy comparison
- Using justified text in print-inspired editorial layouts

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use left-alignment for body text (most readable)
- Center-align headlines and display text
- Use justified text only for specific editorial contexts
- Maintain consistent alignment within content blocks

**Don'ts**
- Justify body text on screens (causes uneven spacing)
- Right-align body text (difficult to read)
- Mix alignment styles randomly
- Use center alignment for lengthy paragraphs
