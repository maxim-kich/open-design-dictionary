- Coding survey open-ended responses to find patterns in customer feedback

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Familiarize yourself with the data through multiple readings
- Code data systematically with clear definitions
- Look for patterns and themes across the dataset
- Involve multiple researchers when possible
- Document your coding process and decisions
- Validate themes against original data

**Don'ts**
- Start coding without understanding the full dataset
- Force data to fit preconceived themes
- Ignore outliers and contradictory data
- Use overly broad or vague themes
- Skip reviewing and refining themes
- Work in isolation without peer review
