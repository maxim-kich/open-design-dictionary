# Tree Testing

## Definition
A usability method that evaluates the findability and labeling of topics in a navigation structure by asking participants to locate items in a text-only hierarchy. Tree testing validates information architecture before visual design.

## Examples
- Testing a website's navigation structure to see if users can find "Return Policy" in the menu hierarchy
- Validating app navigation by having users locate features using only the menu structure

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Test before investing in visual design
- Use realistic task scenarios
- Test with 30-50 participants for reliable data
- Measure success rate, directness, and time
- Compare multiple navigation structures
- Iterate based on results

**Don'ts**
- Include visual design or branding
- Use vague or ambiguous task descriptions
- Test with internal stakeholders only
- Rely on tree testing alone
- Skip validation after changes
- Make navigation too deep without testing
