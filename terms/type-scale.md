# Type Scale

## Definition
A system of font sizes based on mathematical ratios (e.g., 1.125, 1.25, 1.618) for consistent sizing across UI elements. Type scale ensures visual hierarchy and coherence without arbitrary font size choices.

## Examples
- Using a 1.25 (major third) ratio to generate heading sizes from body text
- Implementing a modular scale: 12, 15, 19, 24, 30, 37px
- Applying golden ratio (1.618) for dramatic size differences in editorial design
- Documenting type scale in a design system for consistent usage

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use established ratios (golden ratio 1.618, major third 1.25, minor third 1.125)
- Document type scale in design systems
- Apply type scale consistently across all components
- Scale type responsively for mobile and desktop

**Don'ts**
- Use arbitrary font sizes without ratios
- Create type scales with too many steps
- Ignore type scale in responsive design
- Break type scale for special cases without documenting
