# Typography Contrast

## Definition
Difference in weight, size, color, or style between typographic elements. Contrast creates visual interest, guides focus, and establishes hierarchy to improve scannability and user comprehension.

## Examples
- Pairing a bold headline with light body text
- Using size contrast between H1 and H2 headings
- Applying color contrast between primary and secondary text
- Combining serif headings with sans-serif body for stylistic contrast

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Use high contrast for key information
- Combine multiple contrast dimensions (size + weight + color)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)
- Apply contrast strategically throughout interface

**Don'ts**
- Use low contrast that reduces readability
- Create too many contrast levels (overwhelming)
- Ignore accessibility contrast requirements
- Use contrast solely for decoration
