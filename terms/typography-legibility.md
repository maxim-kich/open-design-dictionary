# Typography Legibility

## Definition
Ease of distinguishing individual characters from one another. Legibility depends on font design, size, spacing, and contrast. High legibility is essential for accessible, user-friendly interfaces.

## Examples
- Choosing fonts where 'I', 'l', and '1' are clearly distinguishable
- Testing character clarity at small sizes (12-14px)
- Ensuring adequate contrast between text and background
- Selecting fonts with open apertures for better character recognition

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Choose fonts with clear character distinction
- Use adequate font size (minimum 12px for body text)
- Ensure sufficient contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Test legibility at actual usage sizes

**Don'ts**
- Use overly decorative fonts for body text
- Use font sizes below 12px for extended reading
- Use low contrast (fails accessibility standards)
- Ignore individual character clarity
