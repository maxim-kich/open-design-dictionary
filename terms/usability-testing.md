# Usability Testing

## Definition
A research method where representative users attempt realistic tasks with a product or prototype while observers watch, listen, and take notes. Usability testing reveals where users struggle, identifying design problems and opportunities for improvement.

## Examples
- Watching 5-8 users complete a checkout process to identify friction points and errors
- Testing a mobile app's navigation by having users find specific features while thinking aloud

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Test with 5-8 users per round for best ROI
- Use realistic tasks that match actual use cases
- Encourage thinking aloud during tasks
- Observe without helping or explaining
- Take notes on behavior, not just opinions
- Test iteratively throughout development

**Don'ts**
- Test with too many users in one round
- Help users or explain how things work
- Ask leading questions during tasks
- Rely only on post-task surveys
- Test only once at the end
- Ignore small usability issues
