# User Interviews

## Definition
One-on-one conversations with users to understand their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points. User interviews collect qualitative data through open-ended questions and are typically conducted in the early discovery stages or to complement other research methods.

## Examples
- Conducting 30-minute interviews with 8-10 target users to understand their daily workflows before designing a productivity app
- Speaking with customers who recently churned to identify usability issues and unmet needs
- Interviewing expert users to uncover advanced use cases and feature requests
- Running discovery interviews with potential users to validate problem space before building

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Ask open-ended questions that encourage storytelling
- Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- Follow up on interesting responses with "why" and "tell me more"
- Record sessions (with permission) to capture nuances
- Take notes on body language and emotional reactions
- Prepare a discussion guide but remain flexible

**Don'ts**
- Ask leading questions that bias responses
- Jump to solutions during the interview
- Interview only power users or only novices
- Rely on what users say they want instead of observing behavior
- Conduct interviews without clear research objectives
- Skip synthesis and analysis after interviews
