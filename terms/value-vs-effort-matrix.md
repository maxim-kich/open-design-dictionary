# Value vs Effort Matrix

## Definition
A 2x2 prioritization framework plotting initiatives based on their expected value to users or business and the effort required to implement. Also called Impact-Effort Matrix, it helps identify quick wins and avoid low-value, high-effort work.

## Examples
- Plotting feature requests on a matrix to identify "quick wins" (high value, low effort) for next sprint
- Using the matrix to explain why certain high-effort, low-value features should be deprioritized

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**
- Involve cross-functional teams in scoring
- Use relative rather than absolute scoring
- Focus on the quadrants (quick wins, big bets, fill-ins, time sinks)
- Revisit and update the matrix regularly
- Consider value to both users and business
- Use the matrix to facilitate prioritization discussions

**Don'ts**
- Spend too much time on precise scoring
- Only do "quick wins" and ignore strategic big bets
- Let personal preferences bias value estimates
- Ignore the "time sinks" quadrant (low value, high effort)
- Make the matrix overly complex
- Use effort alone as the deciding factor
